# JavaProjects
Studying Games Design and Programming - I Use java, Here are some *goofy* projects made during the Java Classes.
This software that I have programed in NetBeans goes along the lines of the lessons but we can use our own imagination and creativity to implement the stuff we have learned in the lesson




___

**Dick Measuring Software**

This is a Jpanel Forum with multiple types of inputs, Using this gives a 100% accutrate representation of the size of your penis.

___

**Baby Generator**

This project is my introduction into Java Variables and Arrays in full, Im new to java but not javascript, so this wasnt completly new but it uses random number
generators but you wont see a Baby boy with a girls name thanks to ```IF``` Statments.

___

**PCMR Quiz**

My self-introduction to ```jToggleButtons``` because they're not like normal buttons in a jPanel Form. This is automated and obfuscated so its harder to reverse engineer but not impossible. *PCMR :P*
